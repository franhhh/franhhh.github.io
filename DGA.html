    <h1> Sprite Sheet Animation </h1>
    <h2> Pigeon Character </h2>
    <p> Hey, my name is Fran and this page is to showcase my sprite sheet animation which was done on procreate and unity. 
        Using procreate to create each individual animation, and unity was used to combine each animation and make the final mp4.</p>
